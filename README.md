# COSINE Tutti Fruttie Game
Created a Match-3 Game featuring the COSINE staff using my own coding knowledge and online tutorials. The game consists of 2 screens (Main menu and gameplay), buttons on the main menu that either start the game or exit the application, a timer, score, and match-3 gampeplay mechanics.

## How to play
The game is fairly simple, just match 3 of the same COSINE members, either vertically or horizontally and score points. When new objects spawn and they automatically form a match, the points stack and create a multiplier which in return gives you more points. To run the game, execute "Match 3 Game Starter".
